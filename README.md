# Medi-Lock


MEDI-LOCK is a website or portal that aims to eliminate the need for physical medical documents by allowing users to upload and save their medical records online. This includes reports such as MRI, thyroid, blood, diabetes, and cholesterol reports, as well as x-rays. Patients are given a personal online storage area in the cloud that is connected to their unique ID, allowing for the sharing of validated electronic documents across doctors and healthcare organizations. The goal of MEDI-LOCK is to reduce the use of paper documents and promote the interchange of digital data across healthcare organizations. This project aims to provide a platform for medical health care services, such as preserving patient medical records and removing the need for physical documentation.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement is that there is currently no platform specifically designed for the medical sector that allows patients to view and store their medical records digitally using a unique ID. The current platforms lack adequate data storage security and access security, making it difficult for patients to carry and handle their medical documents. This leads to inefficiencies in the healthcare system and can compromise the privacy and security of sensitive patient information. Therefore, there is a need for a secure and efficient platform that can address these issues and improve the overall procedure for managing medical records.

## Functionality
